# RunwithMe

This project is an app that will record the distance, duration and dates of miles ran to track progress. The
runner will need to carry a smart phone with them to track activity by inputting information to get reports. The features
in this app will include:
* A “master loop” where the user can repeatedly enter commands, including choosing to exit the program
* A log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
* Calculated and displayed data based on an external factor
